# Machine Learning:
- Supervised learning (prediction and classification)
  - Regresion (SVM, SVR, SVR with kernel, LinearSVR and Polynomial features)
  - Classification (Decision tree, Random forest, XGBoost, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM and SVM with grid search)
- EDA (implementing exploratory data analysis)
- Sentiment Analysis (implementing Vader model)
